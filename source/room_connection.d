// possible to blow it, although usually under synthetic scenarios like load test scripts.
// If you blow the send queue you can miss messages about users joining/leaving and so on and the
// client can get out of sync; there's not currently a good way to get them back in sync although
// they can always rejoin the room if desired.
// That said, setting it too high can cause high memory use, which is not desirable either. Thus
// we need some sort of middle ground, even if it's a little glitchy with the load testing scripts.
